# problems-lastdigitfactorial

Question:

You are given a number N and your task is to find the last digit of the factorial of N, the last digit should not be 0, so ignore trailing zeros and last digit should be greater than 0. For Example, If N=10, the factorial value is 3628800, after ignoring trailing zeros the last digit is 8, so the output is 8.

Input Description:

The first line contains an integer N (1<=N<=10^20).

Ouput Description:

Print the the last digit of the factroial of N and the last digit should be greater than 0(Ignore Tailing Zeros)

Sample Input:

5

Sample Output:

2

Explanantion:

The factorial of 5, i.e., 5! is 120(5*4*3*2*1), after ignoring trailing zero, the last digit is 2, so the output is 2
